# Protein_Abundance_Predictor
BCH 399N Final Project

In this project we cleaned and normalized raw data from mRNA sequences, RNA abundances, and Ribosome Profiling. We used data from 
multiple cell lines to create a machine learning model that would predict the protein abundance for a 7th line. There are 4331 
proteins per cell line.
